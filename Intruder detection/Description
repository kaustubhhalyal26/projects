Intruder detection is the process of detecting intruders behind attacks as unique persons. 
This technique tries to identify the person behind an attack by analyzing their computational behaviour.
An intrustion detection system (IDS) is a software application or hardware appliance that monitors traffic moving 
on networks and through systems to search for suspicious activity and known threats, sending up alerts when it finds such items.
