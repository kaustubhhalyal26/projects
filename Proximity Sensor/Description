A proximity sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact. 
A proximity sensor often emits an electromagnetic field or a beam of electromagnetic radiation (infrared, for instance), 
and looks for changes in the field or return signal.
Proximity sensors are commonly used in industrial applications, from manufacturing and food production to recycling. 
They are also used in vehicles for detecting the proximity of other vehicles relative to one's own car, 
as well as for parking-assist functions.
